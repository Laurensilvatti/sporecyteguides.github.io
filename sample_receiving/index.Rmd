## Sample Receiving

1. **Morning Check:**
   - Check all three mailboxes outside for any samples delivered after hours or early that morning.
   - Process these samples first.

2. **Delivery Processing:**
   - Handle FedEx drop-offs first, as they are usually the largest.
   - Later, process UPS and USPS deliveries as they arrive.

## Before Preping the Samples

### 1. Making the Basket

1. **Open the Shipment:**
   - Carefully open the packages with scissors at the edge where the package was folded to avoid damaging the Chain of Custody (COC) forms inside.

2. **Identify the Order Type:**
   - Check if the order is an APP job or one that needs to be entered into the system:
     - **COC Present:** Fill out the COC with your initials, date, time, and samples received.
     - **No COC / AQ# Present:** It’s an APP job. Write the AQ number and/or inspector's name on a sticky note and place it in the basket with the samples.

3. **Shipping Label Reference:**
   - If the shipping label has a reference, stamp a "Prepaid label" stamp on the COC or the sticky note.
   - Open all packages and sort them into their respective baskets.

### 2. Data Entry

#### For APP Jobs:
1. **Log in:**
   - Go to [shop.sporcyte.com](https://shop.sporecyte.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=shop_order).

2. **Enter Order Details:**
   - Look up the AQ# or the inspector's name.
   - Ensure the selected order matches the sample barcodes.
   - If the order has a "Prepaid label" stamp, add shipping to the order:
     - In the "Item" section, click "add item(s)" → "add product" → type "fed" → select "2-day FedEx Return Shipping" → add → recalculate → OK.
   - Update the "order custom fields" with today’s date for sample received and scanned dates.
   - Change the status from "pending payment" to "On hold".
   - Click "update".

#### For Orders with COC:
1. **Log in:**
   - Go to [mobile.sporcyte.com](https://mobile.sporcyte.com/main).

2. **Create New Job:**
   - Search for the inspector’s name and select the correct inspector. Verify the company name and email domain if the name doesn’t appear.
   - Fill in the property information as per the COC. Use "-" if no address, city, or zip code is provided.

3. **Enter Sample Information:**
   - Specify if the sample is indoor, outdoor, or surface.
   - Enter sample type and location as per the COC.
   - Input the barcode details:
     - Air-O-Cells: Use the last 4 digits of the barcode.
     - Surface Slides, Allergenco-D Posi-Track, Allergenco-D: Use the entire barcode.
     - Surface Swabs: Create a barcode abbreviation (e.g., Lower Level Bathroom = LLB).
   - Add Duration and Flow for Air-O-Cells (usually 5 and 15, respectively).

4. **Complete the Order:**
   - Click "create Job" → "Finish".
   - Write the AQ# on the top right of the COC.
